## Introduction
Welcome to the Library Management System! This Java-based system aims to automate various tasks in a library, including managing books and library members, searching for books, borrowing, and returning books.

## Objectives
- Properly handle errors using exceptions.
- Validate program state using assertions.
- Utilize collections and generics for efficient data management.
- Implement search functionality using strings and regular expressions.

## Project Tasks
### Task 1: Implementing the Book and Member Classes
- **Book Class**: Represents a book with properties such as Title, Author, ISBN, and IsAvailable status.

### Task 2: Managing Collections
- Utilize generics to manage collections of books and members.

### Task 3: Implementing Search Functionality
- Allow users to search for books by title or author using string manipulation and search techniques.

### Task 4: Handling Book Checkouts
- Implement a checkout system where members can borrow books if available, handling exceptions for unavailable books.

### Task 5: Assertions and Input Validation
- Use assertions to ensure proper book checkout and return processes.
- Validate user inputs, such as email formats, using regular expressions and exceptions.

## Additional Features
- Simple text-based menu system for user interaction.
- Robust error handling with user-friendly error messages.
- Clear and concise code with proper comments explaining the logic.
